// Both open a session WITHOUT verifying any credential. Auth.js allowed that
// from a Credentials provider's `authorize`; Better Auth has no provider that
// bends the same way, so each becomes a small plugin with an endpoint of its
// own. The endpoint does what `authorize` used to do, then creates the session
// itself instead of returning a user and letting the library do it.
//
// They are separate rather than sharing a factory on purpose: deleting one is
// deleting one block.
//
// NEITHER ASKS FOR A SECOND FACTOR, and that is a decision rather than an
// oversight. Both open a session without verifying anything, so a 2FA check
// bolted on here would be guarding a door that has no lock: whoever can reach
// the endpoint has already passed. What keeps them safe is what always kept
// them safe — dev is refused outside development, demo only exists when
// DEMO_MODE is on — and on top of that the demo account is not allowed to turn
// 2FA on at all (src/app/actions/two-factor.ts), because the nightly reset
// would strand the next visitor with a factor nobody holds.

     *     not ask for a TOTP on top of Google, which does that better);
