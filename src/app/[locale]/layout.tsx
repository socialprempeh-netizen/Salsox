   * a reload made it look fine again.
   *

   * passed explicitly rather than inherited: what the client is handed cannot
   * disagree with the URL it was asked for.
   *
   * The root one stays for the areas outside this prefix: the dashboard, the
   * admin panel, the sign-in pages and the 404, which always render in the
   * default locale but still read their strings from the message files.
