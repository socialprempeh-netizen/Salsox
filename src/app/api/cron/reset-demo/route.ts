/**
 * Puts the public demo back to a known state, on a schedule.
 *
 * Wired to a Vercel cron in vercel.json (04:00 UTC daily). Visitors share the
 * demo accounts, so without this the data drifts: documents cancelled, records
 * deleted, and by the second week the demo shows an empty or vandalised app.
 *
 * Two independent guards, because this endpoint deletes every user:
 *
 *  1. DEMO_MODE must be "true". A deployment serving real customers refuses
 *     even if someone hits the URL with a valid secret. This is the one that
 *     matters: a misconfigured CRON_SECRET is an inconvenience, running this
 *     against a production database is not recoverable.
 *  2. CRON_SECRET must match the Authorization header. Vercel sends it on
 *     scheduled invocations; without it the route is a public delete button.
 *     When the variable is unset the route refuses too, rather than defaulting
 *     to open.
