/**
 * Blog cover art, painted with your accent color.
 *
 * **Outside `src/app/[locale]/`, and it has to be.** An image has no language,
 * but the reason is sharper than tidiness: `src/proxy.ts` deliberately skips
 * requests ending in an image extension, so nothing rewrites
 * `/blog/covers/x.svg` onto a locale. Under `[locale]` the only address that
 * answered was `/en/blog/covers/x.svg`, which no post links to, and every
 * cover on the site was a 404 with a green build. `routing.test.ts` pins it.
 *
 * The sources live in `content/blog/covers/*.svg` next to the posts, drawn in
 * neutral grays with two placeholders, `__ACCENT_1__` and `__ACCENT_2__`, that
 * this route fills in. Ship as-is and the covers are grayscale; set
 * NEXT_PUBLIC_BRAND_PRIMARY (and _2) and the same artwork comes out in your
 * brand, with no file to redraw.
 *
 * `KIT_SITE="true"` moves the source to `content/blog-kit/covers/`, next to
 * the posts of that same second blog. That folder is **not** in this
 * repository: without the flag this route only ever reads
 * `content/blog/covers/`, which is the one you have. See `src/lib/blog.ts`.
 *
 * A static file dropped in `public/blog/covers/` wins over this route, so
 * hand-made covers (a photo, an exported PNG) keep working: just point the
 * post's `cover` frontmatter at it.
