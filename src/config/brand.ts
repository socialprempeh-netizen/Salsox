/**
 * The neutral mark: a hex socket head, the screw you turn to fasten a part.
 * It stands in for your logo until you swap it, and it lives here because two
 * files draw it and they have to draw the same shape: the logo in the page
 * (src/components/logo.tsx) and the favicon (src/app/icon.tsx).
 *
 * One path, two subpaths, `fill-rule="evenodd"`: the socket is a hole, so the
 * tile shows through it. Painted as a solid shape it would need the tile's
 * colour, which in dark mode is a translucent tint and not a colour we can
 * name. It used to be the plain lucide hexagon, which is what every dark tile
 * with a lucide icon in it looks like, down to live sites already shipping
 * that exact one. The socket costs a subpath and is nobody else's.
 *
 * The head covers 19.5 of the 24-unit box, not the 18 a lucide icon covers.
 * That is deliberate: the hexagon was drawn filled *and* stroked at 1.5, and
 * the stroke added half its width all around. Filling alone at 18 would have
 * shrunk the mark by 8% in every place that asks for it by size, the auth
 * pages and the loader included. Drawn at 19.5 they all keep the size they
 * already ask for.
