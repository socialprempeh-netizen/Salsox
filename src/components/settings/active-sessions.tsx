/**
 * Every device currently signed in to this account.
 *
 * Since 2.0 a session is a row carrying the IP address and user agent it was
 * created with, so this page needed no new storage: it is the first thing that
 * schema change bought, made visible.
 *
 * Note what is NOT rendered, and now not even loaded: the session token. The
 * list sends ids to the server actions, which look the token up themselves
 * (src/app/actions/sessions.ts).
 *
 * The rows are read here with Prisma rather than through the library's
 * `listSessions`, which requires a session created less than `freshAge` ago
 * (a day by default) and answers "Session is not fresh" otherwise. That is the
 * right rule for ending a session, and the wrong one for looking at the list:
 * this card exists for the moment somebody suspects a device is not theirs,
 * which is never within a day of signing in. Reading our own rows, scoped to
 * the caller, is the same answer without that condition. Ending a session still
 * goes through the library, which does not ask for a fresh session.
