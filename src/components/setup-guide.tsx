/**
 * The first page of a fresh clone, until the database is ready: three steps,
 * with the one you are on marked. It replaces the landing rather than sitting
 * on it, because at this point the landing has nothing to show: its plans come
 * from the database.
 *
 * It does not repeat the guide. It says where you are and links to
 * `/docs/getting-started`, which every clone serves from its own `docs/`
 * folder, so this works offline and there is one text to keep right.
 *
 * Rendered only in development: see `pendingSetup()`.
