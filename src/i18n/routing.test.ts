 * These tests exist for one reason, and it is not tidiness.
 *
 * The private areas are matched by prefix in `src/proxy.ts`. If a locale
 * segment could appear in front of them, `/it/dashboard` would not start with
 * `/dashboard` and would stop looking protected. The design answer is that
 * those URLs do not exist at all, because the route groups live outside
 * `src/app/[locale]/`.
 *
 * That property is easy to break later by moving a folder, and nothing else
 * would notice: the build stays green and the page renders. These tests pin
 * the two halves of it.
