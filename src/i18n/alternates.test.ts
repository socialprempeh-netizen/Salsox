/**
 * These pin an SEO rule whose failure is silent and slow.
 *
 * Every page under `[locale]` resolves in every locale, because an
 * untranslated one falls back to English rather than 404. Announce those URLs
 * as alternates and you have told a search engine that two addresses hold the
 * same page in two languages, when they hold the same page in one: duplicate
 * content, published by us, about ourselves, discovered months later as a
 * ranking that went nowhere.
 *
 * Nothing else can catch it. The pages render, the build passes, and the
 * markup is well formed either way.
