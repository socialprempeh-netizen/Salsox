 * Locale routing for the public site.
 *
 * **Only the public surface is localized.** The dashboard, the admin panel,
 * the sign-in pages and the API live outside `[locale]`, so a URL like
 * `/it/dashboard` does not exist. That is a deliberate simplification and a
 * security property at once: `src/proxy.ts` matches private routes by prefix,
 * and a locale segment in front of `/dashboard` would stop those prefixes from
 * matching. Keeping the private area out of the prefix removes the problem
 * instead of asking every future route list to remember it.
 *
 * If you want your dashboard localized too, move those route groups under
 * `src/app/[locale]/` and teach `proxy.ts` to strip the locale before it
 * compares prefixes. The strings are already extracted, so it is routing work
 * and not a rewrite.
