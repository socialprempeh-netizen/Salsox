Quick pointers:

- The fastest possible start is in [Getting started](./getting-started.md): you can run the kit locally with just a database, no OAuth apps needed (there is a dev-only login).
- Every environment variable is listed with comments in [.env.example](../.env.example) and explained in [Configuration](./configuration.md).
- Found a security issue in the kit? Report it privately through [our security policy](https://github.com/openstarterkit/nextjs-saas-starter-kit/security/policy), please do not open a public issue.
- What already shipped in Salsox is in [content/changelog.md](../content/changelog.md), rendered at `/changelog`. The starter kit's own history is in its [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/openstarterkit/nextjs-saas-starter-kit/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) upstream.
