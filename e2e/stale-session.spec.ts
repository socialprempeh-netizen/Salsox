/**
 * The state every other test is blind to: signed in, but not recently.
 *
 * Sessions stay valid for days; the library calls a session "fresh" only for
 * `freshAge` after it was created, a day by default. So somebody who signed in
 * yesterday is signed in and not fresh, which is the ordinary case rather than
 * an edge one. Every other test signs up first and therefore never leaves that
 * first day: this one moves the clock on the row instead.
 *
 * What it pins down is the settings page rendering at all, which it used to
 * answer with a crash: the list came from the library's `listSessions`, the one
 * call in the kit that wanted a fresh session. It is read from our own rows
 * now. Ending a device is checked from the same old session, because that is
 * the moment the feature exists for: nobody suspects a device on the day they
 * signed in.
